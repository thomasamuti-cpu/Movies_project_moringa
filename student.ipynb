    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "As major companies increasingly invest in original video content, our company has decided to enter the entertainment industry by launching a new movie studio. However, the organization currently lacks experience in film production and does not have a clear strategy for deciding what types of movies to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary business goal of this project is to reduce the risk associated with entering the movie industry by using data-driven insights to understand which types of films are performing best at the box office today and identify patterns related to movie genre, rating, viewership, and finanical performance (income generation and production costs).\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing current box office trends and successful films, this project will provide actionable insights that can guide the leadership of the new movie studio in making informed decisions about what kinds of movies to produce. These insights will help the studio prioritize film types that are more likely to achieve commercial success, maximize return on investment, and compete effectively with established studios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the findings from this analysis will support strategic decision-making around film development, allowing the company to enter the market with a clearer understanding of audience demand and industry trends.\n",
